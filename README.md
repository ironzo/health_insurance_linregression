# Health Insurance Charges Prediction

## Project Description
This project aims to predict health insurance charges based on demographic and health-related features of individuals using a linear regression model. This model has 0.77 R-squared score. The linear regression algorithm was chosen only due to learning purposes and more complex models should give better results.
